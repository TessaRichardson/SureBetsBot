## SureBets Arbitrage Bot üåêüí∞

Optimize risk-free betting opportunities with automated odds scanning and Kelly-optimal staking.

SureBets Arbitrage Bot is a Python-based project that finds sports betting arbitrage opportunities (surebets) across different bookmakers and determines the optimal stakes to wager using the Kelly Criterion. It features a modular design with components for fetching odds, calculating arbitrage, sizing bets, and a Streamlit dashboard for visualization. This project showcases ##how a data-driven approach can exploit pricing inefficiencies in betting markets to achieve steady bankroll growth with minimal risk.

# Motivation

In sports betting, arbitrage betting involves placing bets on all possible outcomes of an event using different odds providers to guarantee a profit, no matter the result. Such opportunities arise due to inconsistencies in bookmakers‚Äô odds. They are risk-free in theory but hard to find manually and often yield small margins (1-5%). This project was motivated by the challenge of automating the detection of these surebets in real-time and maximizing profit through optimal bet sizing. We apply the Kelly Criterion for bankroll management ‚Äì a strategy known to maximize long-term growth ‚Äì to decide how much to stake on each arbitrage opportunity. The result is a bot that can potentially turn many small, low-risk profits into meaningful returns over time. Beyond betting, the project was also an exercise in building a robust data pipeline and interactive tool, demonstrating skills in API integration, algorithmic logic, and web app development.

Features
	‚Ä¢	Automated Odds Fetching: Continuously retrieves live odds from multiple bookmakers or an odds API. Supports a mock mode with sample data for testing and development.
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Arbitrage Detection: Scans the odds for arbitrage opportunities in sports events (two-outcome and three-outcome markets). Flags opportunities where the combined implied probability falls below 100%, indicating a surebet.
	‚Ä¢	Kelly Criterion Bet Sizing: Calculates the optimal stake distribution for each outcome of an arbitrage bet. Uses a configurable fractional Kelly approach to balance aggressive growth with risk management. Ensures that the profit is the same regardless of which outcome wins.
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit Dashboard: Includes an interactive web dashboard for monitoring the bot. Displays current arbitrage opportunities, a running log of bets, and key performance metrics (like current bankroll and total profit). Features charts (with a clean, Yan¬†Holtz‚Äìinspired aesthetic) such as a live bankroll growth curve, for visualizing progress. Users can adjust parameters (e.g., Kelly fraction, refresh rate) and even manually input odds to see calculated stakes.
	‚Ä¢	Modular Architecture: The project is organized into self-contained modules ‚Äì Odds Fetcher, Arbitrage Calculator, Bet Sizer, Strategy Engine, etc. ‚Äì making the code easy to maintain, test, and extend. Each component can be improved or replaced independently (for example, plugging in a new data source or adding support for a new sport) without breaking the whole system.
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD and Containerization: Equipped with a GitHub Actions workflow for running tests (and potentially scheduling the bot or updating data). A Docker setup is provided, allowing the entire application (bot + dashboard) to be run in a container for consistency across environments. This makes deployment to cloud or running on different machines straightforward.

Architecture

The bot‚Äôs architecture follows a clear pipeline from data collection to user interface. Below is a high-level diagram of the system:
